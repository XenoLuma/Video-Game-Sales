As a bit of a gamer I got curious and wanted to see how some of my favorite game publishers have been doing sales wise around the world. I found this data set containing a varity of 
games, there publishers, and sales data from three continent/countries; North America, Europe, and Japan. I decided to extract the data from the top ten publishers that released the most content 
and make a line chart one there sales and a stacked bar chart on which genre has the most sales. Made the charts based on the continents/countries sales.
